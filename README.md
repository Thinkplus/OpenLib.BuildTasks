OpenLib.BuildTasks
==================

OpenLib.BuildTasks is a C# library that provides custom MSBuild
tasks for simplifying development with MSBuild scripts.

OpenLib is a collection of libraries written in C# for .NET.
It provides extensions, helpers, and abstractions to commonly
used .NET classes and technologies. The goal of OpenLib is to
provide a 100% free, open source framework to .NET developers
to simplify their solutions.
